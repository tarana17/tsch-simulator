This example demonstrates a **hierarchical** topology.

It uses a preconfigured link based radio connectivity model. There are three types of nodes:
1) Root node
2) Forwarder nodes
3) Leaf nodes

Each forwarder and leaf node generates traffic.
Each forwarder is connected to the root node and to all leaf nodes, and forwards traffic.
Each leaf node is connected to all forwarder nodes.
