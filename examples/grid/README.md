This example demonstrates a **grid** topology.

There is only one type of node. Each non-root node generates traffic, forwards traffic, and is connected to its one or direct neighbor nodes in the grid.

The file `config.json` has node positions automatically generated, as configured by this line:
 * "POSITIONING_LAYOUT": "Grid"
